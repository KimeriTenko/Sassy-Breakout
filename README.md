# Sassy-Breakout
## This Breakout game will be styled using Sass

Breakout is a 1976 Puzzle Game by Atari. Originally designed as a single-player version of Pong, it involves moving a paddle back and forth to break bricks with a ball. When all the bricks are destroyed, a second wall will appear. Destroy that and you win the game.

The game was very popular in arcades, and inspired legions of imitators. Its creators, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, were inspired to go and found their own company, Apple.

It had three official sequels. Super Breakout featured multiple paddles and balls, balls trapped above the bricks, and an advancing wall. It was an Endless Game with infinite new walls.

# Game Logic
Player uses the paddle element to break through several rows of colored bricks.
# MVP Criteria
Player's "paddle" will move left and right, start ball movement and repel ball collisions. Game will have a score.

# Post-MVP Plans
I would like to give the game elements a neon glow and simple outlines for a pleasant, modern feel. It would also be nice to make a custom art title screen. I would like to add other modes of game play ala Super Breakout style. Would also be nice to add musical tones to block breakage. Higher levels result with shortening of paddle and increased ball speed.

# Project Planning
Breakout will use plain JavaScript, Sass, and HTML5 to render and animate the game. The game's main components will be broken down as follows:

index.html: this file will construct the basic html and link the css and javascript files.
style.css: this file will hold stylesheet characteristics.
javascript.js: this file will contain basic methods for collision detection and movements of objects.
